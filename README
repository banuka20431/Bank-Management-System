        > Only bank account holders can apply for a loan.
        > The applied loan's monthly installment amount should be under [ holderAccBalance * 25% ].

        > The lowest loan amount is 500, 000.00
        > That means to get a loan of a minimum amount with 20% interest for 1 year an applier must have
            a credit balance of Rs. [ ( 500, 000 / 12 ) + ( 500, 000 / 12 ) * 20 / 100 ].00 in their account
            longer period = higher interest rates
        > Monthly installment will be deducted from debtor acc balance
        > The total given loan amount should always be less than 50% of the total bank's assets
        > bank's total assets at any given instance =
